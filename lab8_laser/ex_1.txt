before starting roslaunch greenline mapping.launch. there is only odom and base_footprint in the rqt_tf_tree
It likes the initialization. after running. the map node will provide the information to the Odom and the base_footprint 
will send information to 5 nodes. All of them are related to the robot. The wheel's angular and linear speed, and also data of 
lidar are in them. So, the robot position and direction can be calculated from the information.  

the difference between odom and map:
In an ideal world, both odom and map will be fixed and in the same location when SLAM is executed. However, the world is not ideal. 
The odom frame is useful as an accurate, short-term local reference, but drift makes it a poor frame for long-term reference.
The map frame is useful as a long-term global reference, but discrete jumps in position estimators make it a poor reference frame for local sensing and acting.
combined with odom and map will have a better result.
